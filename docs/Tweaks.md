# Makeing a MASQKit extension


### Overview:

MASQKit aims to make artwork themeing dead simple for everyone. 

With that philosophy in mind, as a developer you only need to have 
a basic understanding of adding / controlling UIView's to be able 
to implement this to a satisfactory level. 


### Extensions, why this is the way:

Extension's might seem counterintuitive at first, it's a whole 'nother tweak just to 
add one feature something simple, but I hope by the end of this you'll understand the clear benefits.

If you still do not see why, then you are not ready to begin using MASQKit, so please read
over until it makes sense. 

I think the best way to get the point across is using some real-world examples of how this 
will lead to the best result for users of your software & MASQKit.
