MASQArtworkView Public Documentation / Usage:

-(id)initWithThemeKey:(NSString *)key frameHost:(UIView *)host imageHost(UIImageView *)imgView;

"key" represents the theme key as a string in which the artwork view registers itself to listen for updates to the user's configured theme.
Recommmended Keys fp

"frameHost" represents the view's frame you would like to follow, with greater needs than a plain CGRect,
generally this would be the UIImageView with your artwork/ the highest super in your stack that matches the artwork view frame.

"imageHost", rather straightforward is the UIImageView which contains the artwork image already, a handy helper to our own purposes.

For some convoluted situations, you may find yourself in-need of private methods to achieve your ideal result.
I am happy to expand on their usage in corressondence at masqsubmissions @ gmail . com ,
but are cautiously without guaruntee to works the same way and therefore not recommended/supported for long-term stability / expectations.

MASQBlurredImageView Public Documentation / Usage:

-(id)initWithThemeKey:(NSString *)key;

"key" similar to above, represents the key associated with the desired style for this view.

Else, it is recommended you utilize one of the two current supported keys from the Core Preferences, and direct users accordingly;
@"CC" /* Control Center type plugins */ @"LS" /*  Lockscreen type plugins */

-(void)updateThemeForStyle:(int)
